description: I apply Ultrasound imaging techniques to analyze the shape of the tongue during speech production. This provides bio-visual feedback for speech therapy. Additionally, I utilize Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) to study the articulatory movements of the tongue, lips, and jaw. <br/><br/> The results of these studies shed light on the mechanisms of speech production.
