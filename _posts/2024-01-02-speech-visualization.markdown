description: I apply Ultrasound imaging techniques to analyze tongue movements in speech production and offer bio-visual feedback for speech therapy. Additionally, I utilize Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) to study the articulatory movements of the tongue, lips, and jaw. <br/><br/> My doctoral training also provided fascinating insights into the mechanisms of speech production through these advanced techniques.
