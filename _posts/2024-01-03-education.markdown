description: In my journey, I began with a focus on English language education during my undergraduate studies at Ewha Womans University in South Korea. I then transitioned to the field of Linguistics during my time in Australia. My academic pursuits led me to further training in Linguistics at CUNY Graduate Center, culminating in the achievement of my Ph.D. in Linguistics. <br/><br/> Alongside my doctoral studies, I also engaged as a pre-doctoral researcher at Haskins Laboratories and completed a Masters in Communication Disorders.
