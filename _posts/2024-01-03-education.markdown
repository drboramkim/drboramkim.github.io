description: In my journey, I began with a focus on English language education during my B.A. at Ewha Womans University in South Korea. I then transitioned to the field of Linguistics during my time in Australia. My academic pursuits led me to complete my Ph.D. in Linguistics at CUNY Graduate Center. Alongside my doctoral studies, I also engaged as a pre-doctoral researcher at Haskins Laboratories and completed a M.S. in Communication Disorders.
