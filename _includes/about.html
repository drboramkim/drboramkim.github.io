        As a linguist and speech-language pathologist, I'm passionate about utilizing technology to assist bilingual individuals facing speech difficulties or impairments. My research is focused on delving into the acoustic-articulatory aspects of speech production among bilingual speakers, employing Ultrasound biofeedback techniques for therapeutic interventions. Additionally, I explore prosodic features in individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).

  Outside of my professional pursuits, I find joy in activities like rock climbing, biking, and snowboarding!</p>
